# Chatbot Deployment Guide

## Overview

Hi there! Through my own experiments with different chatbot models and hosting setups, I‚Äôve learned a lot about what works best for speed, cost, and usability. This guide is a collection of those findings‚Äîdesigned to help you set up a chatbot that fits your needs, whether you‚Äôre looking for something lightweight and local or a more powerful cloud-hosted solution.

From testing, I found that smaller models like Mistral-7B work surprisingly well for quick responses on personal machines, making them great for internal tools or support bots. On the other hand, fine-tuned models really shine when trained on specialized data, like legal or finance-specific assistants. If you need a chatbot that retrieves information from large documents, vector search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) makes a huge difference‚Äîperfect for things like knowledge bases or policy search tools.

This guide walks you through choosing the right model, configuring deployment, and optimizing performance while keeping costs low. Whether you're self-hosting or using cloud GPUs, I‚Äôve tested different setups so you don‚Äôt have to.

## 1. Deployment Options

### **1.1 Cloud GPU Hosting (Pay-As-You-Go)**

For fast deployment without maintaining hardware, consider:

- **RunPod** (cheapest, \~$0.20/hr for A100 GPU)
- **Lambda Labs** (good long-term dedicated servers)
- **Vast.ai** (flexible spot pricing)
- **AWS EC2 GPU instances** (for more enterprise-focused scaling)

| **Provider** | **Best GPU Option** | **Hourly Cost** | **Monthly Estimate (24/7)** |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **RunPod**  | A100 (80GB)       | $0.20 - $0.50  | $150 - $400 |
| **Lambda**  | A100 (40GB)       | $0.30          | $220 - $500 |
| **Vast.ai** | RTX 4090          | $0.40 - $0.80  | $300 - $600 |
| **AWS EC2** | A10G (24GB)       | $0.72          | $500 - $1000 |

#### **Steps to Deploy on Cloud GPU**

1. **Launch a cloud GPU instance**
   ```bash
   ssh user@your-cloud-server-ip
   ```
2. **Install Ollama (or other inference engine)**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0
   ```
3. **Expose API for Remote Access**
   ```bash
   ufw allow 11434/tcp
   ```
4. **Connect via API from any device**
   ```python
   import ollama
   response = ollama.chat(model="mistral", host="http://your-cloud-server-ip:11434", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
   print(response["message"]["content"])
   ```

### **1.2 On-Premise Hosting (Self-Managed GPU Server)**

For lower long-term costs and full control:

- **Used RTX 3090/4090 Desktop** (\~$800‚Äì$2000)
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** (\~$500) for lightweight inference
- **Dedicated workstation with 64GB RAM and high-end CPU**

| **Hardware** | **VRAM** | **Cost Estimate** |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **RTX 3090** | 24GB | $800 - $1200 |
| **RTX 4090** | 24GB | $1600 - $2000 |
| **Jetson Orin Nano** | 32GB | $500 - $700 |

#### **Steps to Deploy on Local Server**

1. **Install Ollama or Open Source LLM Server**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama serve
   ```
2. **Optimize GPU Usage**
   ```bash
   ollama serve --use-cuda  # If using an NVIDIA GPU
   ```
3. **Set Up Private Network Access**
   - Use **WireGuard or Tailscale** for secure remote access
   - Set up a **reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik)**

## 2. Model Configuration and Selection

### **2.1 Configuring Models in Ollama**

- Install models:
  ```bash
  ollama pull mistral
  ```
- Limit response length for faster responses:
  ```python
  response = ollama.chat(model="mistral", options={"num_predict": 50})
  ```

### **2.2 Alternative Models for Different Use Cases**

| **Model** | **Use Case** | **Performance** | **Memory Requirement** |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **TinyLlama (1B)** | Fastest, low-memory | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | 2GB+ RAM |
| **Mistral-7B** | Balanced speed vs quality | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | 8GB+ RAM |
| **Llama-2-13B** | High understanding, slower | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | 16GB+ RAM |
| **GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)** | Highest accuracy, high cost | ‚ö° | Cloud-only |

## 3. Proprietary Data & Integration

### **3.1 How to Train or Fine-Tune on Proprietary Data**

| **Method** | **Best For** | **Tools** |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Business knowledge retrieval | FAISS, ChromaDB |
| **Fine-tuning with LoRA** | Custom AI response tuning | Hugging Face, PEFT |

## 4. UI Integration Over Private Network

### **4.1 Setting Up a Private API for UI Access**

Deploy a **FastAPI backend** that your UI can call:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import ollama

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: dict):
    user_input = request["message"]
    response = ollama.chat(model="mistral", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}])
    return {"response": response["message"]["content"]}
```

### **4.2 Reviewing Different Model Implementations**

Each model is chosen based on **scalability, performance, and data sensitivity**, depending on the chatbot‚Äôs intended use.

| **Model Name** | **Description** | **Best Use Case & Example** |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **finetuned_mistral7b** | A fine-tuned version of Mistral 7B, trained on specific industry datasets to improve accuracy for targeted tasks. | Best for **domain-specific chatbots**, such as a **legal AI assistant** trained on case law or a **medical chatbot** specialized in patient FAQs. |
| **local_llama** | A locally hosted Llama model that runs on-premise, eliminating the need for cloud-based inference. | Useful for **offline environments** where internet access is limited, such as **an AI-powered document search tool** for internal legal teams or **a military intelligence chatbot** that processes classified reports. |
| **myenv** | A controlled virtual environment setup for testing and running different chatbot models. | Ensures **consistent dependencies** when developing or **switching between different AI models**, such as testing **multiple LLMs for customer service** before choosing the best performer. |
| **rulebased_chatbot** | A chatbot that follows predefined rules and decision trees instead of using generative AI. | Works well for **structured automation**, such as **an FAQ bot for IT support**, where users select from a **fixed set of troubleshooting steps**. |
| **sql_langchain** | Integrates LLMs with SQL databases, allowing chatbots to generate and execute SQL queries dynamically. | Best for **real-time data access**, such as **a financial chatbot that pulls the latest stock prices from an SQL database** or **an internal HR assistant** that retrieves employee records based on queries. |
| **vectorsearch_rag** | Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using vector search for more relevant responses from large datasets. | Ideal for **knowledge-intensive applications**, such as **a research assistant that fetches relevant academic papers** or **a corporate chatbot that retrieves company policies from internal documents**. |
